# Advent of Code 2019 Solution Code

Here I am, working backwards on Advent of Code problems. This is my solution code for the 2019 AoC problems. All problems can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019. Problems frequently include the use of advanced techniques such as recursion and the use of various data structures. Each day features two parts, with Part Two being a (usually more advanced) continutation or modification of Part One.

The sample data provided can be found in the sampleData folder; real data in the realData folder. Data is automatically populated in the solution code js files using Node's ***fs*** module.
